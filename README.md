# Short Schema

A proof-of-concept succinct [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) language.

# Motivation

JSON is a commonly used machine-readable data format.
Placing your data in JSON makes it very easy for people to programmatically use your data.
It is, therefore, unsurprising that JSON schemas are written in JSON.

However, machine-readable is not the same as human-readable,
   and even though JSON is more readable than XML
   it is not as readable as a format explicitly designed to be read by a human.

# Purpose of this tool

At present this tool takes JSON schemas in JSON and outputs the same schema in our more human-readable standard.

# Caveats

- There is at present no parser for this schema language: only a way of producing this schema.
- May not be complete - hand run on a view schema's by hand.


# Installing

```
pip install git+https://github.com/talwrii/short_schema#egg=short_schema

# Examples / Cheat sheet

[{one: integer, ?two: [integer]}]

```
